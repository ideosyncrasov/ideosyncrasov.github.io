        <h1>Organizing Complexity</h1>
<p>It's the second last day before submission (or what's left of it). I started
working on the game about three hours ago. Most of this time was spent
reorganizing code. Having everything crammed into one huge main files with
dozens of global variables is never a good thing, time pressure or not.</p>
<p>There is now much more separation between the individual parts of the game
(updating game state, drawing game state, etc.), which helps me figuring out
how to implement the game logic. I've always found organizing code (i.e.
figuring out "what goes where") difficult. What helps me reduce the cognitive
dissonance induced by this problem is to work iteratively: just put in anything
that works; you'll figure out soon enough if it sucks.</p>
<h1>Other Problems</h1>
<p>I've run into another problem: I don't know how to play sound in loops! The
engine I'm using doesn't expose this capability. Guess I'll have to worry about
other problems (of which there are plenty). But this will have to wait for
tomororrow, for it is very late already.</p>
