        <h1>Last-Minute-Effort</h1>
<p>There are officially 15 hours 38 minutes and 23 seconds left. Not a whole lot,
but let's try anyway.</p>
<p>First thing to do, implement animations/state transitions. As I mentioned
yesterday, I find it generally hard to conceptualize such things (despite or
maybe because of a strong tendency to conceptual thinking). My momentary
solutions is to maintain a list <code>active-animations</code> in my game state, which is
a list of subclasses of an abstract base class <code>animation</code>.
This base class defines three generic methods:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>(defgeneric animate (animation state))
(defgeneric draw (animation state))
(defgeneric post-animation (animation state))
</pre></div>


<p>Here <code>state</code> is a variable holding the game state. The first method is called
in <code>update-world</code> and does some actions depending on the subclass, so there's
one subclass for every kind of animation. The <code>animate</code> method return a boolean
that indicates whether the animation is finished or not. If it is finished it
is removed from <code>active-animations</code> and the method <code>post-animation</code> is called.
Note that the <code>animate</code> method can itself push new animations to the front of
<code>active-animations</code>, so that one animation can trigger another animation.
Finally, <code>draw</code> is called on each rendering step.</p>
<p>In this way I hope to be able to piece together the logic of the game, without
having to write one huge game logic function.</p>
<h1>It Didn't End Well</h1>
<p>I did manage to submit something that <em>looks</em> like a game just five minutes
before the deadline. There is no game play, and it is not a game. Also, because
I was running out of time, I had to adopt a 'whatever-works mentality'. That
produced some truly horrible code. But I don't care. It's very later (or rather
very early). I failed. I don't care. Good night.</p>
