        <h1>A Myriad Little Details</h1>
<p>Okay, this time I'll keep this very short, since it's already <em>very</em> late and
I'm quite tired. I didn't get to work on my game until about 8 pm, and I (of
course) didn't manage to get as far as I intended, but at least I've now got
a player character that can walk around with animations.
Getting even such a simple thing to work took <em>way</em> longer than it should have,
but the devil's in the detail, and of course there were some bugs that needed
to be weeded out. I'm not very happy that I didn't get to spend any time on
working on the gameplay, but at least I was able to do a fair bit of cleaning.
Tomorrow I plan to code some basic UI and a way to script things, and I hope
I'll finally able to work on gameplay too.</p>
<p>Good night.</p>
