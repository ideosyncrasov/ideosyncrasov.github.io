        <h1>A New Day, a New Start</h1>
<p>Alright, next day. Bad news: I wasted the night trying to fix a stupid bug in
my iOS app (turned out to be an AutoLayout issue), and after doing a bit of
necessary shopping it's already 4 pm. Good news: Borodust has already fixed the
issue that prevented me from using his <code>trivial-gamekit</code> yesterday. Time for
some prototyping!</p>
<h1>Pen and Paper Prototyping</h1>
<p>I figured it would be more productive to develop the gameplay idea using pen
and paper; coding (and typing) just takes <em>so much</em> longer than scribbling
something one a piece of paper.</p>
<p>A few hours and two A4 papers densely covered in writing later, I have a rough
idea of how the gameplay mechanics should look. Basically, the internal state
of the game is represented by a graph together with a set of internal variables
of the player, representing his emotional and mental state. So, the graph
represents the externally visible state, whereas the "hidden variables" the
subjective one.</p>
<p>Each vertex of said graph represents a situation/scene (e.g. <code>player lies on
bed</code>, <code>player sits on bed</code>), and where each edge presents an "action"
(visualized by an appropriate animation). Such an action can lead from one
situation to a different one (e.g. action <code>get up</code> transitions
from <code>player lies in bed</code> to <code>player sits on bed</code>) or lead back to the same
situation (e.g. <code>keep dozing</code>), only affecting the internal state.</p>
<p>The internal variables are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Awareness/Consciousness</li>
<li>Arousal/Calmness</li>
<li>Mood</li>
<li>Wants (hunger, thirst)</li>
</ul>
<p>With the exception of the last variable, which is discrete, all these variables
are continuous and one-dimensional (i.e. real numbers), and they effect the
gameplay in different ways.</p>
<p>For example, <em>Awareness</em> has two effects. First, a sufficient level of awareness
is necessary to even make decisions. Otherwise, these "decisions" (i.e. actions)
are solely determined by habits and wants, i.e. which edge transition is chosen
is determined randomly, with pre-set proabilities that are influenced by the
<code>wants</code>. Higher levels of awareness dampen the influes of wants, and increase
the probability that the players choice coincides with the action his character
takes.
Second, awareness allows the player to recognize the emotional state (internal
variables) of his character, and open up more, less stereotypical choices.</p>
<p>The effect of <em>Mood</em> is that a positive mood makes it more likely to be able to
take an action that is perceived as unpleasant (e.g. cleaning up your room).</p>
<p>The effect of the <em>Calmness</em> variable is that it influences the influence (yes,
that's meta) of the mood variable. To wit, having a good mood in a state of
extreme excitation is ecstasy, whereas having a bad mood in the same state is
insanity.</p>
<h1>The Sketch of a Sketch</h1>
<p>As I said <a href="https://ideosyncrasov.github.io/day-1">Yesterday</a>, I envision this game to be the movie <em>Groundhog
Day</em> turned into a roguelike (if this roguelike was a text adventure). More
concretely, the game should take place in the apartment of someone who is
continually kept in a vicious circle of unhealthy decisions, and should focus
on his daily routine.
Of course the goal of this game (if it will ever exist) is to gain control of
one's life, that is of the actions of the player character, by making
appropriate choices that lead to more internal freedom and less addiction.</p>
<p>That's the rough idea at least. We'll see whether it will stay one.</p>
