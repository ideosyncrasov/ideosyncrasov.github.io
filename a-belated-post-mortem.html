        <h1>Against All Odds</h1>
<p>Welcome back world! I'm finally doing the post-mortem for the 'game'
I submitted to the Lisp Game Jam 2017 that happened in October. And what do you
know, my submission came in first place (as unlikely as that sounds)!
More precisely, the ratings were as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>

<th>Overall score</th>
<th>Creativity score</th>
<th>Presentation score</th>
<th>Entertainment score</th>
<th>Theme integration score</th>
<th># Votes</th>

<p>As you can see, the ratings have to be taken with a big grain of salt since
there were so few of them. Also note that the above scores are not the <em>raw</em>
scores but scores that take into account the number of ratings. The winner in
terms of raw scores would actually be the game that is last in the above
ranking.</p>
<p>But if there is at least one thing I can deduce from this table, then it is
that my entry succeeded in terms of presentation.</p>
<h1>What Went Right</h1>
<p>So the decision to spend time on implementing a tile-based renderer did pay off
in the end, because it allowed me to make use of some well-made assets done by
other people. It's really worth stressing the fact that my game contained <em>no
gameplay whatsoever</em> and still was relatively well received. A good
presentation can go a long way!</p>
<p>Having something decent to look at was also something that motivated me
<em>during</em> development. Also, writing this blog really helped me order my ideas,
even though it took away a little bit of development time. In particular,
I really recommend writing about what you want to do on a particular day
<em>before</em> you do it, for the very same reason that it orders the ideas in your
head and makes you more focused.</p>
<h1>What Went Wrong</h1>
<p>It is very tempting to look at your own creations with rose-tinted glasses and
evaluate them with too much forgiveness because they are 'your own children'.
At the same time, it is also very tempting to be overly critical of yourself
<em>in hindsight</em> (especially if you are doing that self-criticism in public,
because it allows you to think of yourself as a righteous person); in a sense,
the 'later I' that evaluates the work of the 'former I' is a kind
of <em>arm chair expert</em>. And so, one must be very cautious with judgements after
the facts.</p>
<p>One should also make a distinction between 'mistakes' and 'things you should
not have done', i.e. between mistakes that were <em>worth making</em> and those that
<em>weren't</em>. For example, here are some mistakes that I don't regret making:</p>
<ul>
<li>I focused on developing the graphics instead of the gameplay. Developing the
  tile-based renderer turned out to be way more time-consuming than I thought,
  because it resulted in several new sub-tasks (understanding the .tmx file
  format, creating extra tiles for the tilesets).</li>
<li>Spend the last few hours of the game jam with polishing the look and feel.
  For example, during that time I implemented a simulation of night/daytime
  colour changes.</li>
<li>I went with a slightly unorthodoxic game idea that I was interested in,
  instead of sticking with something more traditional and realistic.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason why I don't regret the first two mistakes follows from the above
discussion: even I had no gameplay to show for at all, at least it succeeded in
the area of visuals. The reason I don't regret the third mistake is that
I doubt I would have had the motivation to work much at all on the game had it
been something my heart was not in.</p>
<p>How about mistakes I regret? Well, ...</p>
<ul>
<li>Staying up 'just a little bit more' to get things done is a stupid idea <em>in
  general</em> because a) spending two more hours on game development when you are
  tired and exhausted is less efficient than spending those same two hours when
  you are fresh and awake, and b) disrupting your sleep schedule really lowers
  your creativity and productivity on the next day. However, this does <em>not</em>
  apply to the very last day before the deadline: if I hadn't 'crunched',
  I would not have been able to submit anything at all.</li>
<li>Sacrificing things you normally do for game development. Again, this comes
  with the same caveat as the mistake above, in the sense that it doesn't apply
  to the day before the deadline. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend that you miss
  events or activities you would do normally in order to have more time for
  development. What good does a few more hours do if you spend those hours
  feeling miserable because you denied yourself an accustomed source of
  pleasure?</li>
</ul>
<h1>The Real Challenge Lies Ahead</h1>
<p>Okay, so the game jam is now well over, and technically it even was a success.
Now what? Well, now comes the hardest part, because now the task of completing
the game presents itself to me, and I have no energy-spending deadline ahead of
me that pushes me to work, no people to compete with and compare myself with.
Rather, what lies ahead of me the long, slow, and lonely crawl to completion.</p>
<p>Wish me luck!</p>
